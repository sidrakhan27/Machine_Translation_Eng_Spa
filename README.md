# Transformer Neural Machine Translation (NMT) Model

This project implements a Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model translates sentences from one language to another using an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms.

## Features

- Transformer architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- Multi-head self-attention mechanism.
- Positional encoding for handling sequence order information.
- Text preprocessing using TensorFlow TextVectorization layers.
- Training, validation, and testing pipeline using TensorFlow Dataset API.
- RMSprop optimizer with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss for training.
- Customizable parameters for vocabulary size, sequence length, and batch size.
- Easily adaptable to different datasets and languages.

## Project Structure

- `transformer_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Transformer model.
- `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, including text tokenization and vectorization.
- `data`: Directory containing the dataset files. You can replace these with your own dataset files.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:  

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Execute the Jupyter Notebooks (`machine_translation.ipynb`) to train the model and preprocess the data.

4. Modify the hyperparameters, dataset paths, and other configurations as needed for your specific task.

5. Evaluate the model's performance using the testing pipeline and deploy it for inference.
